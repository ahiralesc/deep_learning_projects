# Deep learning projects

Welcome. I have started this repository with the aim of contributing to the dissemination of artificial intelligence. I find this area of knowledge fascinating since it is based on solid mathematical knowledge many of the times inspired by biological systems, psychological models, among other areas of knowledge.

From a pedagogical perspective, learning becomes meaningful and enriching when solid scientific foundations are used to address both daily and/or basic science open problems. As many journey man, I have beneficiated from code that many others have shared. I will always procure to give credit and reference those who have helped me grow. I have included some artifacts to the learning process, which I have found very useful, such as experimental model, data set processing utilities, among other elements. I welcome any feedback and recommendations.

To facilitate access to my projects, my projects are listed in the following table. Please note, that due to the sensibility of some of the case studies, not all of the projects are accompanied with a dataset. Whenever possible, I will reference you to the data owner so that you may request it via the proper channels.

Many of the projects are embedded in a Jupiter notebook. For those where experimentation is exhaustive, I prefer to build scripts to automate many of the data processing and learning tasks. So you will find both classes of project structures. 


| Problem name             | Problem class  | Problem                                              | Heuristic               |
|--------------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| [Bike sharing](bike_sharing/)| Prediction     | Given a time instance, predict the bike sharing load | FNN                     |
| [Dog breed classification](dog_breed/) | Classification | Given a dog image, predict is breed class  | CNN + transfer learning |
| [TV Script generation](tv_script/) | Prediction | Given a character, predict the persons lines       | RNN |
| [Face generation](faces/) | Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network for generating faces | Given a set face dataset, train a generative model to produce fake faces | DCGAN |
| [Multiclass classification](cohort/) | Prediction | Multilabel text classification. Given a narrative of a patient medical stated predict 13 health outcomes (in working process)| Multiclass text classification |
| [The hidden message](autoencoder/)|Generative|Given an encoded message, create a decoder capable of decoding the encoded message|AE (Auto-Encoder)|
